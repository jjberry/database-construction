=====================

Tools for the construction of an articulatory speech database.

Starting from a plain text corpus, such as a cleaned wikipedia dump, these
tools are designed to help the user create a phonetically balanced list of
sentences to use as prompts for data collection. The tools were developed for
Italian, using the PAISA plain text corpus as the starting point
